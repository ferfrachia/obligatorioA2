<h2><a name="IE9"></a>Support for SVG in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9</h2>
<p>
	Support for SVG in IE9 is currently <i>disabled</i> in the evaluation version.
	In the commercial version you can use the following code to test for IE9
	and enable SVG rendering (without foreignObjects) in CSS1Compat mode:
</p>
<pre>
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE 9') &gt;= 0 &&
    document.compatMode == 'CSS1Compat')
{
  mxClient.IS_VML = false;
  mxClient.IS_SVG = true;
  mxClient.NO_FO = true;
}
</pre>
<p>
	Note that this is not the deafult compat mode in IE9. To enable this compat
	mode, you can use the following meta tag in the head section. Without this tag,
	IE9 will run in IE8 quirks mode and VML will be used by default.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=9'/&gt;
</pre>
<h2><a name="FirefoxFocus"></a>Focus in Firefox</h2>
<p>
	Firefox does not allow to programmatically focus DIVs by default. Since
	this affects handling of key events, here is a workaround to allow the
	focus to be transferred to a DIV that acts as a graph container even if
	a shape is clicked (click on the background works normally). The workaround
	is based on the fact that programmatically setting the focus on a DIV in
	Firefox is possible if the tabindex attribute of the DIV is set as described
	<a href="http://www.barryvan.com.au/2009/01/onfocus-and-onblur-for-divs-in-fx/">here</a>.
</p>
<pre>
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Firefox/') &gt; 0)
{
  mxEvent.addListener(graph.container, 'mousedown', function()
  {
    graph.container.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1');
    graph.container.focus();
  });
}
</pre>
<p>
	Note that as a side-effect of this the DIV will have a focus border which you may
	or may not find useful. Also note that the focus is transferred normally if the
	DIV receives a double click, the above solution is just for single-clicks.
</p>
<h2><a name="TransparentHtmlLabels"></a>Opacity style in HTML labels</h2>
<p>
	There is a problem in Webkit (Chrome, Safari) where HTML labels with
	opacities other than 1 don't scale correctly. Try using
	<code>mxClient.NO_FO = true</code> before rendering the graph as a
	workaround for this problem.
</p>
<h2><a name="Chrome5LocalFiles"></a>Local file:// URI in Chrome 5.x</h2>
<p>
	Chrome 5.x no longer loads files from the local filesystem via XHR. This
	affects the loading of resources if examples are viewed via the file://
	protocol. To enable the loading of such files you should use the new flag
	--allow-file-access-from-files.
</p>
<p>
 	See security section for 5.0.335.0 release
	<a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/">here</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="ClippedLabels"></a>Clipped labels</h2>
<p>
	For clipped labels (overflow:hidden or mxGraph.isLabelClipped returns true)
	it is possible that event handling remains as if the label was unclipped.
	There are several browsers and versions that show this behaviour.
</p>
<h2><a name="LocalFiles"></a>Scrollable labels in Webkit</h2>
<p>
	For labels that contain HTML markup with scrollbars in Webkit (Safari and
	Chrome) you should disable the use of foreignObject to make sure the HTML
	is not embedded in the SVG node hierarchy. This is because Webkit has a bug
	where mouse events are ignored in any scrollbars in a foreignObject. To
	disable foreignObjects, the following code can be used:
</p>
<pre>mxClient.NO_FO = mxClient.NO_FO || mxClient.IS_SF || mxClient.IS_GC;</pre>
<p>
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35545">Bug Report</a>
</p>
<h2><a name="LocalFiles"></a>Local Files</h2>
<p>
	For enabling the functionality in mxUtils.save and mxUtils.open for reading
	and writing local files, the security settings for the page need to be
	changed to enabled or prompt for <i>Initialize and script ActiveX controls
	not marked as save for scripting</i> in IE 7.
</p>
<p>
	To enable local file access in Firefox, the page must be loaded using the
	file:// protocol.
	<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/signed-scripts.html">This</a>
	article also states the the access works for signed scripts, however, this
	has not been tested.
</p>
<p>	
	For mxUtils.saveAs in Firefox, the same restrictions apply. However, the
	function may be used in IE7 without any client-side settings.
</p>
<p>
	For local file access in Firefox 3, you need do to an about:config and
	change security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to false. (If some language
	properties are missing in Firefox 3, this is most likely the cause for the
	problem.) This is only required for local file access and not for
	production software deployed on a webserver.
</p>
<h2><a name="Rotation"></a>Rotation</h2>
<p>
	Support for rotation is limited to the shape display. Text labels, handles,
	selection bounds and perimeter points are currently not rotated. Support
	for rotation is limited to SVG/VML dialects in the client, as well as the
	mxGraphics2DCanvas in Java and the mxGdiCanvas in C#. PHP does not
	currently support rotation in GD.
</p>
<h2><a name="EventOrder"></a>Order of Events in IE</h2>
<p>
	When adding listeners for DOM events using mxEvent in IE, which in turn
	uses attachEvent, then the order in which listeners are invoked for a
	specific event is not as listeners have been added. This is a known bug.
	There is no workaround for this problem.
</p>
<h2><a name="Printing"></a>Printing</h2>
<p>
	Printing does not work in Firefox 1.5 (bug 314707). However, it works in
	Firefox 2.0 and later. In Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP (no
	service pack) and Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Server 2003 SP1
	enterprise, SP2 beta build 2825 enterprise and SP2 beta build 2805
	data center there is a
	<a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/29075807/vml-content-created-by-sc.aspx">known issue</a>
	with printing VML content created by script.
</p>
<p>
	In Firefox and Internet Explorer, all content that is wider than one page
	is cropped when printed. Please use mxPrintPreview for printing across
	multiple pages.
</p>
<h2><a name="Statusbar"></a>Statusbar</h2>
<p>
	The status bar is used to display information while the DOM is being
	updated. Therefore, it is not possible to display this information in the
	DOM (as it is being updated). Unfortunately, Firefox and IE do not allow
	scripts to change the status bar. (IE 6 allows it.)
</p>
<p>
	To enable updates of the status bar in IE 7, you can change the security
	setting of the respective zone in Internet Options, Security, Custom Level,
	Scripting, Allow status bar updates via script.
</p>
<p>
	To enable updates of the status bar in Firefox, you can set the
	configuration setting via about:config, dom.disable_window_status_change to
	false.
</p>
<h2><a name="AccessDenied"></a>Access Denied in IE</h2>
<p>
	The latest version of IE does no longer allow to read files from the local
	filesystem. This means that all files must be loaded from a webserver, or
	the native XMLHTTP support must be disabled.
</p>
<p>
	To allow loading files from the local filesystem in IE, you must disable
	native XMLHTTP support in Internet Options, Advanced, Security. Keep in
	mind that loading the client from the local filesystem should only be
	used for development. In production, the page containing the client and
	all files should be loaded from a webserver via HTTP.
</p>
<h2><a name="FontRendering"></a>Font Rendering</h2>
<p>
	In Firefox (including 2.0), the fonts are sometimes cropped at the end of a
	line (some pixels missing). On the Mac, the text sometimes completely
	disappears. The problem seems to be fixed in Firefox 3.0 for Windows. A
	possible workaround is to change the width of the window by at least 1
	pixel.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=368879">Bug Report</a>
</p>
<h3><a name="LabelBoundingBox"></a>Label Bounding Box</h3>
<p>
	In Firefox, the SVG-function getBBox for vertex- and edgelabels is one step
	behind zoom. This means, the bounding box for overlapping labels and the
	label background and border might appear smaller or larger than the text
	after zooming. The display can be updated by panning the graph at least 1
	pixel.
</p>
<h2><a name="Linefeeds"></a>Linefeeds</h2>
<p>
	Linefeeds are converted into &amp;#xa; at encoding time. However, in shared
	diagram sessions the linefeeds (\n) are kept. When sending such XML back to
	the client all linefeeds must be replaced with &amp;#xa;. If you need a
	different encoding you can change the mxEditor.prototype.linefeed and
	mxSession.prototype.linefeed variables. In general, the encoding of
	linefeeds is specified when a DOM node is serialized using the
	mxUtils.getXml(node, linefeed) method. The optional linefeed argument is
	the string to be used for encoding linefeeds and defaults to &amp;#xa;.
</p>
<h2><a name="RunSlowly"></a>Scripts Run Slowly Error in IE</h2>
<p>
	This error (<i>A script on this page is causing internet explorer to run
	slowly</i>) in IE (all supported versions including IE 7) is triggered by
	the script engine executing more than 5 million operations (see
	<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/175500">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/175500</a>).
	A workaround for this problem is using the threads provided with
	<a href="http://gears.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Gears</a>
	or using worker threads in HTML 5.
</p>
<p>
	Another workaround is to set the
	<code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Styles</code>
	DWORD value of <code>MaxScriptStatements</code> to hex <code>7fffffff</code>
	and reboot. Warning: According to the Knowledge Base article, "serious
	problems might occur if you modify the registry".
</p>
<h2><a name="BodyBorder"></a>Body, HTML Borders</h2>
<p>
	When using a style definition for the body or HTML element that makes the
	border invisible, such as none or 0px for the border-width, then there is a
	strange behaviour in IE after dragging cells into the graph. Another click
	is required to stop the respective tool from being inserted again into the
	graph. Currently, the only known workaround is not to use the style
	definition for invisible borders. Invisible borders for body and HTML
	elements are the default setting and the bug does not occur if the border
	is set to something visible, such as 1px solid black.
</p>
<h2><a name="HtmlLabels"></a>HTML Labels</h2>
<p>
	HTML labels are supported in SVG browsers via the mxGraph.htmlLabels
	switch. mxGraph.isHtmlLabel(mxCell) may be overridden to return individual
	values for cells. The following are known limitations for HTML labels:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Oversize labels consume events on transparent regions. This limitation
exists in all browsers.</li>
<li>Zoom does only work for text content. This limitation exists in all non-IE
browsers, eg. Firefox.</li>
<li>Drag and drop (eg. connections) starting at inner img has same cell in
dispatch loop.</li>
<li>Vertical/rotated HTML labels are not supported in Opera.</li>
<li>In SVG-based browsers, the labels appear on top of all SVG in a separate
layer.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="SvgContainer"></a>SVG Container</h2>
<p>
	In Firefox, the size of the SVG element is updated to be the size of the
	graph whenever the graph changes. However, since there is no resize event
	fired by the parent container of the SVG element, the SVG element may have
	to be manually resized if the parent element is larger than the graph. The
	effect of this is that if the container of the SVG element is made larger
	without updating the SVG element's size, then the SVG element (and hence
	the drawing area) will appear smaller than the container of the graph.
</p>
<h2><a name="Opera"></a>Opera</h2>
<p>
	Support for Opera 9 is currently experimental. There are several known
	issues, such as no context menu, cropping in SVG canvas, ignored
	beforeunload handler and drag and drop from toolbar not working. For
	displaying the context menu in Opera (and on Mac), hold down the shift key
	while clicking the (left) mouse button.
</p>
<h2><a name="Safari"></a>Safari</h2>
<p>
	For the context menu to appear in Safari on the Mac, hold down the shift
	key while clicking the (left) mouse button. Safari does not provide the
	beforeunload event. Also, vertical labels are not working in Safari on the
	Mac.
</p>
<h2><a name="Webkit"></a>Webkit (Safari and Google Chrome)</h2>
<p>
    For some container positions there are artifacts in Safari and Google
    Chrome when repainting dynamic SVG elements (eg. highlights and previews).
    This is due to a bug in the Webkit repaint code. Also, the value for text
    opacity is currently ignored in Webkit.
</p>
<h2><a name="PHPStroke"></a>PHP and strokewidths</h2>
<p>
    The strokewidth is currently ignored in some GD implementations, as the
    imagesetthickness function is not working properly.
</p>
<h2><a name="XDomXHR"></a>Cross-domain AJAX</h2>
<p>
	Cross-domain AJAX requests are generally not allowed, so make sure all
	requests are kept within the same domain of the page that contains the
	client. By default, XHR is used for loading the JS files (development
	only), the properties files (i18n) and the XML files (config). In
	production, there is only a single JS file which is not loaded using XHR,
	however, the files for i18n and configuration are still loaded using XHR
	and should therefore be placed in the same domain.
</p>
<p>
	For example, if the translations are missing in the UI you should make sure
	the respective properties files are stored in the same domain as the page
	that contains the client. In this specific case, if you are using IIS, you
	should also check if the MIME type for properties files has been registered
	correctly. If no MIME type has been registered for the .properties
	extension then please do so in the IIS console under IIS, MIME types.
</p>
<p>
	Note that the evaluation distribution uses a hosted version of mxClient. If
	you are experiencing cross-domain security problems using the evaluation
	version then you should upgrade to the commercial version as it includes
	all required files.
</p>
<p>
	There is a known issue where Firefox does not load properties files from
	the local filesystem (file:// protocol) if the mxClient.js files is loaded
	from a different domain (evaluation). This problem goes away when using
	HTTP.
</p>
<h2><a name="Doctypes"></a>Doctypes</h2>
<p>
	There have been several error reports for certain doctypes to affect the
	display and behaviour of the client (eg. no shapes visible in IE). Please
	make sure to <i>not</i> use a DOCTYPE in the page that contains the client.
	If you have a DOCTYPE directive in your page which is causing problems and
	you can't remove or modify, try adding a comment before the DOCTYPE or use
	<code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" /&gt;</code>
	in IE8 as a workaround.
</p>
<p>
	The following table lists all possible doctypes and their effect on mxGraph
	in IE6, IE7, IE8 and IE8 in IE7 compat mode using the tag above (IE8/7).
